                alternative in 2020. My Final year project was “Disease detection using medical reports & suggesting
                expert doctors”, a fully dynamic website. I have used the Python Django framework for powering the
                backed operations. I have completed a course named web designing and freelancing from dimension It
                institute where I have
                learned responsive web design. Currently, I am doing a course guided by Programming Hero where I am

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website
                    and
                    showed it to them. They liked it and uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
                    Hero.
